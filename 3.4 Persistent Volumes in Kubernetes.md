The Nautilus DevOps team is working on a Kubernetes template to deploy a web application on the cluster. There are some requirements to create/use persistent volumes to store the application code, and the template needs to be designed accordingly. Please find more details below:


## Create a PersistentVolume named as pv-devops. Configure the spec as storage class should be manual, set capacity to 5Gi, set access mode to ReadWriteOnce, volume type should be hostPath and set path to /mnt/security (this directory is already created, you might not be able to access it directly, so you need not to worry about it).

## Create a PersistentVolumeClaim named as pvc-devops. Configure the spec as storage class should be manual, request 2Gi of the storage, set access mode to ReadWriteOnce.

## Create a pod named as pod-devops, mount the persistent volume you created with claim name pvc-devops at document root of the web server, the container within the pod should be named as container-devops using image httpd with latest tag only (remember to mention the tag i.e httpd:latest).

## Create a node port type service named web-devops using node port 30008 to expose the web server running within the pod.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sure, I'll guide you through creating the required resources in Kubernetes using YAML configurations. Please note that you need to apply these configurations to your Kubernetes cluster.

1. **PersistentVolume (pv-devops.yaml):**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: pv-devops
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 5Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  storageClassName: manual
  hostPath:
    path: /mnt/security
```

Apply the configuration:

```bash
kubectl apply -f pv-devops.yaml
```

2. **PersistentVolumeClaim (pvc-devops.yaml):**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: pvc-devops
spec:
  storageClassName: manual
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 2Gi
```

Apply the configuration:

```bash
kubectl apply -f pvc-devops.yaml
```

3. **Pod (pod-devops.yaml):**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod-devops
spec:
  containers:
  - name: container-devops
    image: httpd:latest
    volumeMounts:
    - name: storage-volume
      mountPath: /usr/local/apache2/htdocs
  volumes:
  - name: storage-volume
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: pvc-devops
```

Apply the configuration:

```bash
kubectl apply -f pod-devops.yaml
```

4. **NodePort Service (service-devops.yaml):**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: web-devops
spec:
  type: NodePort
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 80
    nodePort: 30008
  selector:
    pod-devops: container-devops
```

Apply the configuration:

```bash
kubectl apply -f service-devops.yaml
```

Now, you should have a PersistentVolume named `pv-devops`, a PersistentVolumeClaim named `pvc-devops`, a Pod named `pod-devops` running the httpd container, and a NodePort Service named `web-devops` exposing the web server on port 30008.

get error

## Website is not up and accessible


If the website is not accessible, there could be various reasons. Let's troubleshoot step by step:

1. **Check Pod Status:**

   Verify that the pod is running successfully:

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods
   ```

   Ensure that the pod `pod-devops` is in the "Running" state.

2. **Check PVC Status:**

   Verify that the PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) is bound:

   ```bash
   kubectl get pvc
   ```

   Ensure that the PVC `pvc-devops` is in the "Bound" state.

3. **Check PV Status:**

   Verify that the PersistentVolume (PV) is bound to the PVC:

   ```bash
   kubectl get pv
   ```

   Ensure that the PV `pv-devops` is in the "Bound" state.

4. **Check Pod Events:**

   Check the events associated with the pod to see if there are any errors:

   ```bash
   kubectl describe pod pod-devops
   ```

   Look for any error messages or issues in the output.

5. **Check Volume Mounts:**

   If the pod is running, ensure that the volume is mounted correctly. You can inspect the pod:

   ```bash
   kubectl exec -it pod-devops -- /bin/bash
   ```

   Inside the pod, check if the volume is mounted at the specified path:

   ```bash
   ls /usr/local/apache2/htdocs
   ```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To ensure that the files from the PersistentVolume (PV) are present within the mounted path in the pod, you can follow these steps. Let's assume you have already accessed the pod using:

```bash
kubectl exec -it pod-devops -- /bin/bash
```

Once inside the pod, navigate to the mount path and list the files. In your case, the mount path is `/usr/local/apache2/htdocs`. Run the following commands:

```bash
cd /usr/local/apache2/htdocs
ls
```

The `ls` command lists the files and directories within the specified path. If the PersistentVolume is successfully mounted and contains files, you should see them listed.

If the directory is empty or you encounter any issues, it's possible that the data is not correctly stored in the PersistentVolume or there might be an issue with the mounting process.

You can also check the contents of the PersistentVolume from the host machine directly (assuming you have access to the host):

```bash
# Replace /your/pv/host/path with the actual path of the PersistentVolume on the host machine
ls /your/pv/host/path
```

This command will show you the contents of the PersistentVolume directly on the host machine.

If the PersistentVolume is empty, you might need to manually copy files into it or review how it was provisioned to ensure that data is being persisted as expected. If you encounter any specific errors or issues, please provide more details so I can assist you further.

   Ensure that the files from the PersistentVolume are present.

6. **Check NodePort Service:**

   Ensure that the NodePort Service is created and running:

   ```bash
   kubectl get services
   ```

   Look for the `web-devops` service and check if it has an external IP assigned.

7. **Firewall and Network Issues:**

   Ensure that there are no firewall issues blocking the NodePort, and network configurations allow traffic to the specified NodePort.

8. **Check Logs:**

   Check the logs of the container within the pod for any errors:

   ```bash
   kubectl logs pod-devops -c container-devops
   ```

   Look for any error messages that might indicate why the web server is not running.

After going through these steps, you should have more information about what might be causing the issue. If the problem persists, please share any error messages or additional information you find, and I can assist you further.
