# The Nautilus DevOps team has started practicing some pods and services deployment on Kubernetes platform, as they are planning to migrate most of their applications on Kubernetes. Recently one of the team members has been assigned a task to create a deployment as per details mentioned below:


Create a deployment named nginx to deploy the application nginx using the image nginx:latest (remember to mention the tag as well)

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.
