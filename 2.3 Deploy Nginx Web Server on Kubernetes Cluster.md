# Some of the Nautilus team developers are developing a static website and they want to deploy it on Kubernetes cluster. They want it to be highly available and scalable. Therefore, based on the requirements, the DevOps team has decided to create a deployment for it with multiple replicas. Below you can find more details about it:


Create a deployment using nginx image with latest tag only and remember to mention the tag i.e nginx:latest. Name it as nginx-deployment. The container should be named as nginx-container, also make sure replica counts are 3.

Create a NodePort type service named nginx-service. The nodePort should be 30011.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can create a Kubernetes deployment and service with the specifications you mentioned by using a YAML configuration file. Here's a sample YAML file for the deployment and service:

```yaml
# nginx-deployment.yaml

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx-container
          image: nginx:latest
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-service
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
      nodePort: 30011
```

Save the above YAML configuration to a file, for example, `nginx-deployment.yaml`. Then, you can apply it to your Kubernetes cluster using the `kubectl apply` command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f nginx-deployment.yaml
```

This will create a deployment named "nginx-deployment" with three replicas, each running an Nginx container tagged with `latest`, and a NodePort service named "nginx-service" with nodePort set to 30011.

The provided text is a YAML configuration file that defines two Kubernetes resources: a Deployment and a Service. Let's break down the different sections and fields in this YAML file:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
```

- `apiVersion`: Specifies the API version to use for the Deployment, in this case, `apps/v1`.
- `kind`: Specifies the kind of Kubernetes resource, which is a Deployment in this case.
- `metadata`: Contains metadata information for the Deployment, including its name, which is "nginx-deployment."

```yaml
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx-container
          image: nginx:latest
```

- `spec`: Defines the specification of the Deployment.
  - `replicas`: Specifies that the Deployment should manage 3 replicas of the specified pods.
  - `selector`: Defines the labels used to match the pods managed by this Deployment. Pods with labels matching these criteria will be managed by this Deployment.
  - `template`: Describes the pod template that the Deployment will use to create new pods.
    - `metadata`: Contains labels for the pod template.
    - `spec`: Specifies the specification for the containers within the pod.
      - `containers`: Lists the containers within the pod.
        - `name`: Specifies the name of the container, which is "nginx-container."
        - `image`: Specifies the container image to use, which is "nginx:latest."

The above section creates a Deployment that will ensure that three replicas of an Nginx container are running, each labeled with `app: nginx`.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-service
```

- `apiVersion`: Specifies the API version for the Service, which is `v1`.
- `kind`: Specifies the kind of Kubernetes resource, which is a Service in this case.
- `metadata`: Contains metadata information for the Service, including its name, which is "nginx-service."

```yaml
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
      nodePort: 30011
```

- `spec`: Defines the specification of the Service.
  - `type`: Specifies that it's a NodePort service, which makes the service accessible on each node at a specific port.
  - `selector`: Specifies the labels used to select the pods that the service will route traffic to, in this case, pods with the label `app: nginx`.
  - `ports`: Defines the ports to expose on the service.
    - `protocol`: Specifies the network protocol (TCP).
    - `port`: Specifies the port number on the service (external).
    - `targetPort`: Specifies the port number on the pods that the service will forward traffic to (in this case, port 80).
    - `nodePort`: Specifies the port number on each node where the service will be accessible (in this case, port 30011).

In summary, this YAML file creates a Kubernetes Deployment named "nginx-deployment" with three replicas of an Nginx container (tagged with `latest`) and a NodePort Service named "nginx-service" that exposes the Nginx pods on port 30011 on each node.
