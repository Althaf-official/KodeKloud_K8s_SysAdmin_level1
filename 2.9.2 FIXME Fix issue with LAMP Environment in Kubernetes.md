One of the DevOps team member was trying to install a WordPress website on a LAMP stack which is essentially deployed on Kubernetes cluster. It was working well and we could see the installation page a few hours ago. However something is messed up with the stack now due to a website went down. Please look into the issue and fix it:



### FYI, deployment name is lamp-wp and its using a service named lamp-service. The Apache is using http default port and nodeport is 30008. From the application logs it has been identified that application is facing some issues while connecting to the database in addition to other issues. Additionally, there are some environment variables associated with the pods like MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD, MYSQL_DATABASE, MYSQL_USER, MYSQL_PASSWORD, MYSQL_HOST.


### Also do not try to delete/modify any other existing components like deployment name, service name, types, labels etc.


Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.

3. **Check MySQL Service:**
   Verify if the MySQL service is correctly configured. Use the following command:

   ```bash
   kubectl get service lamp-service
   ```

   Ensure that the service is of type `NodePort` and that the ports are configured correctly.

4. **Check MySQL Logs:**
   If the MySQL pod is running, retrieve the logs to identify any issues:

   ```bash
   kubectl logs <mysql-pod-name>
   ```

   Replace `<mysql-pod-name>` with the actual name of the MySQL pod.

5. **Check Events:**
   Check for any events related to your deployment that might indicate issues:

   ```bash
   kubectl get events
   ```

   Look for events with timestamps around the time of deployment or when the issue occurred.

It looks like the application is encountering a PHP parse error in the `index.php` file. The error message indicates that there is an issue with the syntax near 'MYSQL_PASSWORD' on line 4.

Here are a few steps to address this issue:

1. **Review `index.php` File:**
   Open the `index.php` file located in the `/app/` directory and check line 4 for any syntax errors. It seems that there might be an issue with how the `MYSQL_PASSWORD` variable is being used.

2. **Correct Syntax Error:**
   Ensure that the syntax for using environment variables is correct. In PHP, you should use the `getenv()` function to access environment variables. For example:

   ```php
   $mysql_password = getenv('MYSQL_PASSWORD');
   ```

   Make sure that the environment variables (`MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD`, `MYSQL_DATABASE`, `MYSQL_USER`, `MYSQL_PASSWORD`, `MYSQL_HOST`) are used correctly in your PHP code.

3. **Update PHP Code:**
   After identifying and correcting the syntax error in the `index.php` file, update the code within the container. You can rebuild the Docker image with the corrected code or manually update the file within the running container.

   For example, you can use `kubectl cp` to copy the corrected file into the running container:

   ```bash
   kubectl cp corrected-index.php lamp-wp-56c7c454fc-jhwsw:/app/index.php
   ```

   Replace `corrected-index.php` with the actual corrected file name.

4. **Restart the Pod:**
   After making changes, restart the Apache/PHP pod to apply the modifications:

   ```bash
   kubectl delete pod lamp-wp-56c7c454fc-jhwsw
   ```

   Kubernetes will automatically create a new pod with the updated code.

5. **Check Logs Again:**
   Once the pod is restarted, check the logs again to ensure that the PHP parse error is resolved:

   ```bash
   kubectl logs lamp-wp-56c7c454fc-jhwsw
   ```

   Look for any new errors or warnings in the logs.

By addressing the PHP parse error and updating the code, you should be able to resolve the issues causing the 500 Internal Server Error. If you encounter any specific error messages or need further assistance, please provide additional details.
