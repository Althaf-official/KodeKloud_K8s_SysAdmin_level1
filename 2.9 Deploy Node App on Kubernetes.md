The Nautilus development team has completed development of one of the node applications, which they are planning to deploy on a Kubernetes cluster. They recently had a meeting with the DevOps team to share their requirements. Based on that, the DevOps team has listed out the exact requirements to deploy the app. Find below more details:


### Create a deployment using gcr.io/kodekloud/centos-ssh-enabled:node image, replica count must be 2.

### Create a service to expose this app, the service type must be NodePort, targetPort must be 8080 and nodePort should be 30012.

### Make sure all the pods are in Running state after the deployment.

You can check the application by clicking on NodeApp button on top bar.


You can use any labels as per your choice.

To create a deployment with the specified requirements and expose it using a NodePort service, you can use a Kubernetes YAML configuration. Below is a YAML configuration that accomplishes this task:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: my-app-container
          image: gcr.io/kodekloud/centos-ssh-enabled:node
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-app-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 8080
      targetPort: 8080
      nodePort: 30012
  type: NodePort
```

Save the above YAML configuration to a file, for example, `my-app-deployment-service.yaml`, and then apply it using the `kubectl apply` command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f my-app-deployment-service.yaml
```

This will create a deployment with two replicas running the specified image and expose it using a NodePort service with the desired port configuration. After the deployment is created, you can verify that all the pods are in a Running state by running:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

Once the pods are in a Running state, you can access the application using the NodePort, which in this case is 30012. If the application provides a "NodeApp" button as you mentioned, you can click on it to check the application.
