# There is an application deployed on Kubernetes cluster. Recently, the Nautilus application development team developed a new version of the application that needs to be deployed now. As per new updates some new changes need to be made in this existing setup. So update the deployment and service as per details mentioned below:


We already have a deployment named nginx-deployment and service named nginx-service. Some changes need to be made in this deployment and service, make sure not to delete the deployment and service.

1.) Change the service nodeport from 30008 to 32165

2.) Change the replicas count from 1 to 5

3.) Change the image from nginx:1.18 to nginx:latest

To make the requested changes to your existing Kubernetes deployment and service without deleting them, you can use the `kubectl edit` command or by editing the YAML files directly. Here's how you can do it using `kubectl edit`:

1. **Change the Service NodePort**:

   Use the following command to edit the service and change the NodePort from 30008 to 32165:

   ```bash
   kubectl edit service nginx-service
   ```

   This will open the service configuration in your default text editor. Locate the `nodePort` field and change its value to 32165. Save the file and exit the editor.

2. **Change the Replicas Count**:

   To change the replicas count from 1 to 5, you need to edit the deployment:

   ```bash
   kubectl edit deployment nginx-deployment
   ```

   This will open the deployment configuration in your default text editor. Locate the `replicas` field under the `spec` section and change its value to 5. Save the file and exit the editor.

3. **Change the Image**:

   To change the image from `nginx:1.18` to `nginx:latest`, you can also edit the deployment:

   ```bash
   kubectl edit deployment nginx-deployment
   ```

   In the editor, find the `containers` section under the `spec` and update the `image` field to `nginx:latest`. Save the file and exit.

By making these changes using `kubectl edit`, you can modify your existing Kubernetes deployment and service according to the specified requirements. The changes will take effect immediately, and your deployment will have 5 replicas, use the `nginx:latest` image, and have the service running on NodePort 32165.
