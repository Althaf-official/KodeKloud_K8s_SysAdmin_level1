The Nautilus application development team observed some performance issues with one of the application that is deployed in Kubernetes cluster. After looking into number of factors, the team has suggested to use some in-memory caching utility for DB service. After number of discussions, they have decided to use Redis. Initially they would like to deploy Redis on kubernetes cluster for testing and later they will move it to production. Please find below more details about the task:


Create a redis deployment with following parameters:

Create a config map called my-redis-config having maxmemory 2mb in redis-config.

Name of the deployment should be redis-deployment, it should use
redis:alpine image and container name should be redis-container. Also make sure it has only 1 replica.

The container should request for 1 CPU.

Mount 2 volumes:

a. An Empty directory volume called data at path /redis-master-data.

b. A configmap volume called redis-config at path /redis-master.

c. The container should expose the port 6379.

Finally, redis-deployment should be in an up and running state.

Certainly! You can use the following YAML manifest to create the Redis deployment with the specified parameters:

```yaml
# redis-config.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: my-redis-config
data:
  redis-config: |
    maxmemory 2mb

# redis-deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: redis-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: redis
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: redis
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: redis-container
        image: redis:alpine
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: "1"
        ports:
        - containerPort: 6379
        volumeMounts:
        - name: data
          mountPath: /redis-master-data
        - name: redis-config
          mountPath: /redis-master
      volumes:
      - name: data
        emptyDir: {}
      - name: redis-config
        configMap:
          name: my-redis-config
---
```

Save the above YAML in two separate files, `redis-config.yaml` and `redis-deployment.yaml`. Apply them to your Kubernetes cluster using the `kubectl apply` command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f redis-config.yaml
kubectl apply -f redis-deployment.yaml
```

This will create a Redis deployment named `redis-deployment` with one replica, using the `redis:alpine` image, requesting 1 CPU, and exposing port 6379. The configuration with a maxmemory of 2mb will be stored in a ConfigMap named `my-redis-config`. Two volumes, an empty directory named `data` and the `redis-config` ConfigMap, will be mounted at `/redis-master-data` and `/redis-master`, respectively.

Make sure to adjust the YAML files according to your Kubernetes setup if needed.

A ConfigMap in Kubernetes is a way to decouple configuration artifacts from container images, allowing you to manage configuration separately from application code. ConfigMaps are used to store non-sensitive configuration data in key-value pairs, and these values can be consumed by pods in various ways.

Here are some reasons why ConfigMaps are commonly used:

1. **Separation of Configuration and Code:** ConfigMaps allow you to manage configuration independently of the application code. This separation makes it easier to update configuration settings without modifying the application itself.

2. **Dynamic Configuration Updates:** ConfigMaps can be updated dynamically, and the changes are immediately reflected in the pods that use them. This is useful for scenarios where you need to adjust configuration settings without redeploying the application.

3. **Environment Agnosticism:** ConfigMaps provide a way to make your application environment-agnostic. Instead of hardcoding configuration values into your application code, you can use ConfigMaps to inject environment-specific values at runtime.

4. **Consistency Across Environments:** Using ConfigMaps makes it easier to maintain consistency across different environments (development, testing, production) by providing a centralized way to manage configuration.

In the specific example you provided, a ConfigMap (`my-redis-config`) is used to store the Redis configuration (`maxmemory 2mb`). This allows you to manage the Redis configuration separately from the deployment definition, making it easier to update or modify the configuration without changing the deployment YAML.

In summary, ConfigMaps help in managing and organizing configuration settings for your applications running in Kubernetes, promoting flexibility, consistency, and separation of concerns.
