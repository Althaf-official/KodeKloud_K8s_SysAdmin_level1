# We are working on an application that will be deployed on multiple containers within a pod on Kubernetes cluster. There is a requirement to share a volume among the containers to save some temporary data. The Nautilus DevOps team is developing a similar template to replicate the scenario. Below you can find more details about it.



Create a pod named volume-share-devops.


For the first container, use image centos with latest tag only and remember to mention the tag i.e centos:latest, container should be named as volume-container-devops-1, and run a sleep command for it so that it remains in running state. Volume volume-share should be mounted at path /tmp/official.


For the second container, use image centos with the latest tag only and remember to mention the tag i.e centos:latest, container should be named as volume-container-devops-2, and again run a sleep command for it so that it remains in running state. Volume volume-share should be mounted at path /tmp/demo.


Volume name should be volume-share of type emptyDir.


After creating the pod, exec into the first container i.e volume-container-devops-1, and just for testing create a file official.txt with any content under the mounted path of first container i.e /tmp/official.


The file official.txt should be present under the mounted path /tmp/demo on the second container volume-container-devops-2 as well, since they are using a shared volume.



---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


To create the pod named `volume-share-devops` with two containers that share a volume and perform the described tasks, you can use a Kubernetes YAML configuration file. Here's a YAML configuration that accomplishes the specified requirements:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: volume-share-devops
spec:
  volumes:
    - name: volume-share
      emptyDir: {}
  containers:
    - name: volume-container-devops-1
      image: centos:latest
      command: [ "sleep", "infinity" ]
      volumeMounts:
        - name: volume-share
          mountPath: /tmp/official
    - name: volume-container-devops-2
      image: centos:latest
      command: [ "sleep", "infinity" ]
      volumeMounts:
        - name: volume-share
          mountPath: /tmp/demo
```

Save this configuration to a file (e.g., `volume-share-devops.yaml`) and apply it to your Kubernetes cluster using the `kubectl apply` command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f volume-share-devops.yaml
```

This configuration creates a pod with two containers (`volume-container-devops-1` and `volume-container-devops-2`) that share an emptyDir volume named `volume-share`. Both containers run the `sleep` command to keep running indefinitely.

To create a file named `official.txt` in the first container (`volume-container-devops-1`) and have it appear in the second container (`volume-container-devops-2`) due to the shared volume, you can use the following commands:

1. First, exec into the first container (`volume-container-devops-1`) and create the file:

```bash
kubectl exec -it volume-share-devops -c volume-container-devops-1 -- /bin/sh
echo "This is official.txt in container 1" > /tmp/official/official.txt
exit
```

2. Then, exec into the second container (`volume-container-devops-2`) to verify the presence of the shared file:

```bash
kubectl exec -it volume-share-devops -c volume-container-devops-2 -- /bin/sh
cat /tmp/demo/official.txt
exit
```

The second `kubectl exec` command should display the content of `official.txt` created in the first container, demonstrating that the shared volume works as expected.

The provided YAML configuration and subsequent commands demonstrate how to create a Kubernetes pod with two containers that share a volume and perform specific tasks. Let's break down the explanation:

1. **YAML Configuration**:
   - The YAML configuration is a declarative representation of the desired state of a Kubernetes pod. It's used to define the pod's name, containers, volumes, and their properties.

   - `apiVersion` and `kind` specify the Kubernetes resource type, which is a Pod in this case.

   - `metadata` contains information about the pod, including its name.

   - `spec` is where you define the pod's specification, including its containers and volumes.

   - `volumes` section defines the volume to be shared between containers. In this case, it's an `emptyDir` volume, which is ephemeral and shared between the containers running in the same pod.

   - `containers` section lists the two containers to be run within the pod. Each container is based on the `centos:latest` image and runs the `sleep` command with the argument "infinity" to keep the containers running indefinitely.

   - `volumeMounts` inside each container definition specifies how the volume should be mounted inside the container. In the first container (`volume-container-devops-1`), it's mounted at `/tmp/official`, and in the second container (`volume-container-devops-2`), it's mounted at `/tmp/demo`. These paths are where you can interact with the shared volume from each container.

2. **Creating the Pod**:
   - After saving the YAML configuration to a file (e.g., `volume-share-devops.yaml`), you can use the `kubectl apply` command to create the pod in your Kubernetes cluster. This command reads the configuration from the file and applies it to your cluster, creating the `volume-share-devops` pod with its two containers.

3. **Shared Volume Interaction**:
   - To demonstrate the shared volume in action, you can use `kubectl exec` to execute commands inside the containers.

   - In the first container (`volume-container-devops-1`), you create a file named `official.txt` in the shared volume at `/tmp/official`.

   - In the second container (`volume-container-devops-2`), you use `kubectl exec` again to verify the presence of the shared file by reading its content from the mounted path at `/tmp/demo`. This confirms that the two containers share the same volume, and changes made in one container are visible in the other.

This setup is useful for scenarios where multiple containers in a pod need to share data or perform coordinated actions. The shared volume provides a means for them to exchange information or collaborate within the same pod.
