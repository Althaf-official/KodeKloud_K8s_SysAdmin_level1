# The Nautilus DevOps team wants to create a ReplicationController to deploy several pods. They are going to deploy applications on these pods, these applications need highly available infrastructure. Below you can find exact details, create the ReplicationController accordingly.


Create a ReplicationController using httpd image, preferably with latest tag, and name it as httpd-replicationcontroller.

Labels app should be httpd_app, and labels type should be front-end. The container should be named as httpd-container and also make sure replica counts are 3.


All pods should be running state after deployment.

Certainly, I'll explain the components of the provided YAML configuration step by step:

1. `apiVersion` and `kind`:
   - `apiVersion: v1`: This specifies the Kubernetes API version used in the configuration. In this case, it's version 1 of the Kubernetes API.
   - `kind: ReplicationController`: This defines the type of Kubernetes resource you are creating, which is a ReplicationController in this case. ReplicationControllers are used to ensure a specified number of pod replicas are running.

2. `metadata`:
   - `name: httpd-replicationcontroller`: This sets the name of the ReplicationController as "httpd-replicationcontroller."
   - `labels`: These labels are key-value pairs that you can use to organize and categorize resources. In this case, two labels are applied: "app: httpd_app" and "type: front-end," which can be used for identifying and selecting this ReplicationController.

3. `spec`:
   - `replicas: 3`: The `spec` section defines the desired state of the ReplicationController. In this case, you want three replica pods to be maintained by this ReplicationController.

   - `selector`:
     - `app: httpd_app`: This is used to specify the label selector for the ReplicationController. It means that this ReplicationController will manage pods with the label "app: httpd_app."

   - `template`:
     - `metadata`:
       - `labels`: Labels applied to the pods created by this ReplicationController. The labels "app: httpd_app" and "type: front-end" are again applied to ensure consistency with the ReplicationController's labels.

     - `spec`:
       - `containers`:
         - `name: httpd-container`: This specifies the name of the container within the pod, which is "httpd-container."

         - `image: httpd:latest`: This sets the Docker image to be used for the container. It specifies the "httpd:latest" image, which is the latest version of the Apache HTTP Server (httpd).

In summary, this YAML configuration creates a ReplicationController named "httpd-replicationcontroller" that maintains three replica pods. The pods are labeled with "app: httpd_app" and "type: front-end," and they run a container named "httpd-container" using the "httpd:latest" Docker image. The ReplicationController ensures that the desired number of pods is always running based on the specified replica count.
